# Google-Foobar

Being an invitee to the Foobar Challenge, I've been able to solve all the levels.Here is my solution to all the 5 levels.

While this can be used as a reference, I kindly forbid you from copying the same code.

NOTE: The python notebook contains the code that can be used to decrypt the encrypted message I obtained after completion of 5 levels.
